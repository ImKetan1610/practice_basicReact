    title: "Whose birth number can I use?",
    info: "It is generally not legal or ethical to use someone else's birth number or other personal identification information without their consent. In many countries, such as the United States, using someone else's personal identification information without their consent is a criminal offense and can result in serious legal consequences. Your own birth number or personal identification number is unique to you and should be used only for legitimate purposes, such as identity verification or tax purposes. You should never use someone else's birth number or personal identification number, even if you have their permission, unless you are authorized to do so by a legal or regulatory authority.",

    title: "When do I recieve a password ordered by letter?",
    info: "I believe you may be referring to a bank-issued password or access code that is sent to you via postal mail. In some cases, when you open a new bank account or apply for a bank's online banking service, the bank may send you a letter containing a temporary password or access code that you can use to log in to your account for the first time. The exact timing of when you receive this letter will depend on the bank's policies and procedures. Some banks may send the letter as soon as your account is approved or activated, while others may wait a few days to allow for processing and verification.",
